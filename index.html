			<h2>Goals, motherfucka, do you have them?</h2>
				<p>
				A) I'd like to become more competent at HTML/CSS and so on, because I've found that it's something I enjoy.
				<p>
				B) Since I happen to be looking for a career change, this is one path that I'm looking into.  If, by the end of this course, or beyond, I feel capable and confident at coding, and feel that it's something I would truly enjoy doing as a career, I would definitely want to pursue that.

			<h2>Concerns....</h2>
				<p>
				My concerns about learning HTML include being able to memorize some of the very basics that I don't already have memorized (ex. element order), though these will likely come with repetition, as with the others.
				<br>
				Likewise with CSS, except I feel there's a far broader range of basics that I still haven't got a firm grasp on- margin/padding/position/floats/selector IDs/etc.
				<br>
				Everything about javaScript concerns me.
				<br>
				On a closely related note, I'm also concerned about getting overwhelmed by large amounts of new information.
